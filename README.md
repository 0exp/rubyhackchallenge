# About the Cookpad Ruby Hack Challenge

Hack the Ruby interpreter at Cookpad!

The Programming language Ruby is widely used on web application development. Of course, programs written in Ruby run on Ruby interpreter.

Cookpad Ruby Hack Challenge (RHC) is a one-day event where we'll teach you how to extend Ruby features, fix bugs, and to improve performance of Ruby.

The first Ruby Hack Challenge was a great success, but it was offered only in Japanese. This time, the Ruby Hack Challenge will be offered in English (English lecture materials and English announcements) as well as Japanese.

Lecture materials: https://github.com/ko1/rubyhackchallenge (currently being translating into English!)

Note that we offer support for English at the event (English lecture materials, announcements and English hacking supports) but we don't restrict our support to English. Japanese language users are also welcome. (in Japanese: イベント自体は英語で行いますが、日本語話者も歓迎します）

One more note: Koichi and another supporter Endoh-san are not native English speakers.
