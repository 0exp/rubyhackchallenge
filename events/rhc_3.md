# About the Cookpad Ruby Hack Challenge

Hack the Ruby interpreter at Cookpad!

The Ruby Programming language is widely used for web application development. Of course, programs written in Ruby run on the Ruby interpreter.

Cookpad Ruby Hack Challenge (RHC) is a one-day event where we'll teach you how to extend Ruby features, fix bugs, and to improve performance of Ruby.

The first two Ruby Hack Challenge's were great successes, but were offered only in Japan. This time, the Ruby Hack Challenge will be offered in the UK!

Lecture materials: https://github.com/ko1/rubyhackchallenge/tree/master/EN

Note: Koichi and Endoh-san are not native English speakers.
